            <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
            <p class="cse-para">Civil Engineering is one of the most rampant disciplines of Engineering. It is the
                oldest engineering discipline after Military Engineering. Cursively, from the word 'CIVIL' one can
                understand the meaning of it. It, roughly, means 'Construction is very important in Life'. But, if we
                have bird eye view on its application and careers, one can understand that, its not only limited to
                construction. It is also applied on the natural structures along with the construction of Dams, Bridges,
                Highways, Roads, Buildings, and Savages etc.
                For those, who want to know about career, it is experimented that jobs offered for civil
                Engineers have more perks and privileges than any other engineering jobs. It must be memorised that, it
                is possible, that might be your first job will not have the most perks privileges. In fact, your first
                job, might be, too hard with low compensation but this job experience and practice will surely lead you
                to a successful life. </p>

            <h3 class=" text-white card">Average salary </h3><br>
            <p class="cse-para">Civil Engineers are responsible for the maintenance of the built environment -
                roads, railways, canals, highways, etc. Civil engineering is one of the most sought-after careers in
                India. The average base salary of civil engineers in India is around INR 25,000 per month and INR
                3,07,507 per annum. This salary, however, tends to differ on the basis of experience.

                On average, the starting salary after becoming a civil engineer in India is around INR 2,42,000
                per annum and can rise to about INR 8,62,000 per annum. The salary also differs on the basis of
                location. For example, on average, civil engineers in the United States earn around INR 46,36,252, quite
                more than civil engineers in India. The salary of a civil engineer also depends on the civil engineering
                courses a candidate has pursued as higher education will grant a higher salary.
